Destory All Music
=================
Playlists - curated playlists of music around a topic... New music, favorite
oldies, etc... - itunes, google play, and spotify lists (software to create?).

Gear Reviews - similar to the setup. Interview people and get lists of their
listening gear (turntables, amps, headphones, speakers, etc...).

Articles - not a blog, because I doubt I'll update in a timely fashion, but it
would be nice to write up favorite artists or groups of artists.
